0.4.4

0.4.5
 - Add optional tracking of BoxUsage
    -> The measure of machine utilization for this request.
    -> Does not include storage or transfer usage.

  rather than requiring the dev to supply the same key multiple times.
  -> This requires changing how the 100-attribute limit is handled.
